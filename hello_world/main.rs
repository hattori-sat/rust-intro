// the main function is the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
fn main(){
    // Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
    // println! : a Rust macro
    // "!" means that you're calling a macro instead of a normal function 
    // and that macros don't always follow the same rules as functions.
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// This is a simple program, so I use the "rustc".
// To manage all the options, I will use "cargo tool".
